Education, the foundation of a quality life, ==has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over== whether students should take courses online or in classrooms. Learning in tradition classroom in some people's views, continues to be  an effective way. ==Contrary to these people's opinions is my perspective that== online learning, which requires students to attend classes on computers or television, is superior , due to the contributions to their academic performance and personal development.

what must be prioritized is that taking distance-learning courses, instead of  having courses in traditional classrooms, is beneficial to students' academic learning, by offering them more knowledge and triggering their enthusiasm in learning. 

to begin with, it is online education that provides students  with the access to a large quantity of expertise.

In detail, on the Internet, students can acquire a wide range of knowledge in history, art and science, enlarging their knowledge base; in contrast, such a large amount of knowledge cannot be obtained when they are instructed by only one teacher in concrete classroom.

Moreover, never can we ignore the significance of distance education to students' interest in learning. To explain it further, by receiving education on the internet , students  will find it more interesting to deal with mathematical problems, do research, and write proposals; on the other hand, will they be passionate about these tasks when teachers always lecture in brick-and-mortar classrooms？

e.g. Employees are encouraged by their supervisor's open-mindedness and will work diligently.

- Being open-minded makes it possible for the supervisors to encourage employees to work diligently.
- It is encouraged for employees to see their supervisor's open-mindedness, who will work diligently.
